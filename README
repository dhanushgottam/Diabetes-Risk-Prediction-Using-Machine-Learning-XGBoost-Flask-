# Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning (XGBoost + Flask)

This project is a machine learning based diabetes prediction system developed using the BRFSS 5050 diabetes dataset. Multiple supervised learning models were trained and compared, and the best performing model (XGBoost) was deployed using a Flask web application for real-time prediction.

## Features

- Machine Learning based diabetes prediction
- Models compared: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes, XGBoost
- XGBoost selected as the best model
- Real-time prediction using Flask API
- Input form for major health indicators
- Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and feature importance graphs generated
- Preprocessing and scaling included
- Models saved as .pkl files for deployment

## Dataset Used

BRFSS 2015 Diabetes Binary 5050 Split Dataset  
Contains more than 70,000 balanced samples with 21 health-related features including:

- HighBP
- HighChol
- CholCheck
- BMI
- Smoker
- Stroke
- HeartDisease
- PhysActivity
- GenHealth
- MentalHealth
- Age
- Sex
- Income
and others.

Target variable:
0 = No Diabetes  
1 = Diabetes  

## Models Trained and Compared

| Model               | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~74%     |
| Random Forest       | ~73%     |
| SVM                 | ~75%     |
| KNN                 | ~72%     |
| Naive Bayes         | ~71%     |
| XGBoost (Best)      | ~75%     |
